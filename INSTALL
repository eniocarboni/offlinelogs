Quick word
==========

Thanks for looking at the Beta version of Offlinelogs - It's been tested only few live repositories and and seems to be stable enough.

Quick Install Guide
===================

(*) EPrints 3.3+

If you're running 3.3 simply use the Bazaar package which is in the epm/ folder. Upload it via [Admin] > [System Tools] > [EPrints Bazaar] > [Available] and scroll down the bottom of the page.


(*) EPrints 3.2

1- get the files from Git

2- copy the files to your local archive:

mkdir -p /opt/eprints3/archives/<ID>/{bin,cfg/cfg.d,cfg/plugins/EPrints/Plugin/Offline}

cp bin/offline /opt/eprints3/archives/<ID>/bin/
cp cfg/cfg.d/z_offline.pl /opt/eprints3/archives/<ID>/cfg/cfg.d/
cp cfg/plugins/EPrints/Plugin/Offline/Handle.pm /opt/eprints3/archives/<ID>/cfg/plugins/EPrints/Plugin/Offline/

3- check the configuration file in cfg/cfg.d/z_offline.pl

  create the log_dir where save the offline logs. Default to /opt/eprints3/archives/<ID>/var/offline/
  These dir must exists (it can be a symlink too)

4- offline the logs (a long time for large logs as milions or tens of millions of records)

  cd /opt/eprints3/archives/<id>/bin/
  ./offline offline <id> --verbose

  # if you want test for some months use can use --todate=YYYYMM as option to offline script
  # add --nodel option to simulate the operation (so will not be deleted log records in the access table and 
  #  will not be saved the index file. This means that the next relaunch we started from scratch)

5- Monthly updates of the stats (e.g. via CRON)
